* Observation 1
  * Students around the college level care less about having their attendence being tracked.
  * This is likely that attendance mean less in college level as only 39% of students chose this. I assume that parents and teachers would be more keen to this.
* Observation 2
  * Students mostly use emails as their means of communication between schools
  * Every student said that they use email as a way to receive school updates
  * Make sure that there are emails sent out with updates in the app
